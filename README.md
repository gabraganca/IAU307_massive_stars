This work will be presented in the IAU symposium 307 entitled [New Windows on Massive Stars](http://obswww.unige.ch/Conferences/IAU307/index.html) which will
be in Geneva, Switzerland, from 22 to 27 of June 2014.


The format of the presentation is **poster**.

**Abstract:**

Abundance gradients are observed in other galaxies, with their metallicities 
decreasing outwards from the galactic centers. The abundance slopes for different 
elements may vary depending on the galactic morphology. In our Galaxy, the radial 
abundance gradients remain somewhat uncertain on the outer parts of the Galactic 
disk, due to the small number of studied stars located beyond the Perseus Arm. The 
aim of this study is to provide a large abundance database of distant stars in order 
to better constrain the Galactic gradient in the Outer Disk. We have obtained 
high-resolution, echelle spectra for a sample of 137 OB stars located towards the 
Galactic anti-center using the 6.5m Magellan Clay telescope + MIKE spectrograph. A 
subsample of 50 single stars presenting sharp absorption lines has been selected to 
carry out the abundance analysis. Stellar parameters, Silicon and Oxygen abundances 
are derived consistently based on non-LTE synthesis of hydrogen, helium, Silicon and 
Oxygen lines, requiring ionization balance of SiII/III/IV and O I/II/III. In this work, 
we present preliminary abundance results of our analysis.
