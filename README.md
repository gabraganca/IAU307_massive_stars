# [New Windows on Massive Stars](http://obswww.unige.ch/Conferences/IAU307/index.html)


The IAU symposium 307 entitled New Windows on Massive stars will
be in Geneva, Switzerland, from 22 to 27 of June 2014.

I will submit my work as a poster.

**Title:** A Spectroscopic Study of OB Stars Located on the Outer Galactic Disk

**Abstract:**

Abundance gradients are generally observed in all galaxies, with their
metallicities decreasing outwards from the galactic centers. The abundance
slopes for different elements may vary depending on the galactic morphology.
In our Galaxy, the radial abundance gradients remain somewhat uncertain on the
outer parts of the Galactic disk, due to the small number of studied stars
located beyond the Perseus Arm. The aim of this study is to provide a large
abundance database of distant stars in order to better constrain the Galactic
gradient in the Outer Disk. We have obtained high-resolution, echelle spectra
for a sample of 137 OB stars located towards the Galactic anticenter using the
6.5m Magellan Clay telescope + MIKE spectrograph. A subsample of 50  single
stars presenting sharp absorption lines has been selected to carry out the
abundance analysis. Stellar parameters and silicon abundances are derived
consistently based on non-LTE synthesis of hydrogen, helium, and silicon lines,
requiring ionization balance of SiII/III/IV. In this work, we present
preliminary abundance results of our analysis.
