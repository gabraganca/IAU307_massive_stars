# [New Windows on Massive Stars](http://obswww.unige.ch/Conferences/IAU307/index.html)


The IAU symposium 307 entitled New Windows on Massive stars will
be in Geneva, Switzerland, from 22 to 27 of June 2014.

I will submit my work as a poster.

**Title:** A Spectroscopic Study of OB Stars from the Galactic Outer Disk

**Abstract:**

Several studies have shown an existence of a metallicity gradient on the
Galactic disk. But, there is a low number of massive stars studied located
in the outer disk. In this work, we try to address this problem.

We have collected a sample of 137 OB stars located in the Galactic outer disk.
These stars were observed using the 6.5m Clay telescope located in Las
Campanas, Chile. After rejecting the ones with bad observation, binaries and
multiples and stars with high projected rotational velocity, we ended up with
a subsample with 50 stars to be analysed. Our methodology consists in
determining the stellar parameters through a iterative method in which the
temperature is obtained by the Si II/III/IV ionization equilibrium, the gravity
by fitting the Blamer lines and the microturbulence velocity is obtained by
removing the dependency of the Si III lines abundances with their equivalent
widths.

In this work, we present partial results from our analysis.
