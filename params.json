The abundance slopes for different \r\nelements may vary depending on the galactic morphology. In our Galaxy, the radial \r\nabundance gradients remain somewhat uncertain on the outer parts of the Galactic \r\ndisk, due to the small number of studied stars located beyond the Perseus Arm. The \r\naim of this study is to provide a large abundance database of distant stars in order \r\nto better constrain the Galactic gradient in the Outer Disk. We have obtained \r\nhigh-resolution, echelle spectra for a sample of 137 OB stars located towards the \r\nGalactic anti-center using the 6.5m Magellan Clay telescope + MIKE spectrograph. A \r\nsubsample of 50 single stars presenting sharp absorption lines has been selected to \r\ncarry out the abundance analysis. Stellar parameters, Silicon and Oxygen abundances \r\nare derived consistently based on non-LTE synthesis of hydrogen, helium, Silicon and \r\nOxygen lines, requiring ionization balance of SiII/III/IV and O I/II/III. In this work, \r\nwe present preliminary abundance results of our analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can download the poster [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1050565).\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease, cite this work as\r\n\r\nBragan√ßa, Gustavo; Lanz, T.; Daflon, S.; Cunha, K.; Garmany, C.
